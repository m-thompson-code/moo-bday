Some have kids. Most if not all of us are not dating each other.
We like adult humor and like to have banter between each other.
We will be drinking and having a fun night at a house party.
We are okay with sexual topics, but nothing too extreme or graphic and don't target each other.
Some of us are sensitive to topics like religion and politics, so avoid those topics.
We want to have fun and get to know each other better.`;

The game is played in rounds, with each player asks another player a question. Then the player that was asked a question must respond to that question.

Each round will have a topic that all players will know. Then a person, place or thing will be chosen from that topic. Everyone except the spy will see that person, place or thing.

The spy must figure out what the topic is and blend in with the other players, while the other players try to figure out who the spy is.

The spy wins a point if they are not voted as the spy at the end of the game. The other players win a point if they correctly identify the spy.

After, the spy may also gain a point if they correctly guess the person, place or thing that everyone else can see.

I will give you the topic and you will give me a person, place or thing from that topic. Your response should be short and concise.`;
