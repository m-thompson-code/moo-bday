export const promptPrefix = `We are playing a game where there is one spy among a group of people. The spy's goal is to blend in and avoid detection, while the other players try to identify the spy.

The game is played in rounds, with each player asks another player a question. Then the player that was asked a question must respond to that question.

Each round will have a topic that all players will know. Then a person, place or thing will be chosen from that topic. Everyone except the spy will see that person, place or thing.

The spy must figure out what the topic is and blend in with the other players, while the other players try to figure out who the spy is.

The spy wins a point if they are not voted as the spy at the end of the game. The other players win a point if they correctly identify the spy.

After, the spy may also gain a point if they correctly guess the person, place or thing that everyone else can see.

I will give you the topic and you will give me a person, place or thing from that topic. Your response should be short and concise.
