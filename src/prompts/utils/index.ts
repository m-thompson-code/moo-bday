Some have kids. Most if not all of us are not dating each other.
We like adult humor and like to have banter between each other.
We will be drinking and having a fun night at a house party.
We are okay with sexual topics, but nothing too extreme or graphic and don't target each other.
Some of us are sensitive to topics like religion and politics, so avoid those topics.
We want to have fun and get to know each other better.`;
